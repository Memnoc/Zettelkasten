I have been studying the zettlekasten method and I wish to apply  it to my workflows and my blog posts.

I mainly itend to use it for computer science topics, but I am pretty sire I can adapt it to different areas.

This method is the pinnacle of  method invented by a german scholar knows as Niklas Luhmann.

The method consists in a systematic classification of ideas and thoughts with a bidirectional linking, meaning: you create a note that links to another that links to aother note etc.

Some advantages of the method are that you can recall the notes even at years of distance and that you do not force the knowledge in pre-made containers but you instead let the knowledge thake it's  own shape.
