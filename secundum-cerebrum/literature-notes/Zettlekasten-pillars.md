The pillars of the zettelkasten system lies in structure.

**Fleeting note**
 - Quotes
 - Ideas
 - Videos
 - Articles
 - Any media consumption or conversation
 
**Literature notes**
 A summary of your understanding from the fleeting notes. It's important that this part is not a copy-paste from the source, but a sincere "what did you understand" of the source you have consumed.

**Permanent notes**
These are notes that consolidate the understanduing. 
They have some strict rules:

 - one idea per card
 - easy to understand in isolation
 - small notes are easier to find

**Finis effectus**
This is my personal touch. It represents a collection of the output of the the zettelkasten process: videos, articles, apps or programs
